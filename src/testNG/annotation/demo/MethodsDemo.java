/*
 * @BeforeMethod: Sets up the test environment by preparing any preconditions needed for each test. This avoids repetition of setup code in each test and ensures a consistent starting state.
@AfterMethod: Cleans up after each test, ensuring that each test starts fresh and doesnâ€™t affect the next one. This is essential for test independence and helps in avoiding side effects between tests.
