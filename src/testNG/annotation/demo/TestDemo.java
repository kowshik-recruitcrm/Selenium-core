/*
In TestNG, @BeforeTest and @AfterTest annotations are used to define methods that should run before and after all the test methods in a specific <test> tag within a TestNG XML file. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation:

@BeforeTest
Purpose: @BeforeTest is used to set up any preconditions or configurations that need to be in place before executing all tests in a <test> tag.
Usage: You might use @BeforeTest to open a database connection, set up an application environment, initialize test data, or configure certain settings that apply to all test methods within the <test> tag.
Example: Logging in as an admin user, initializing a specific configuration, or launching a browser only once before all test methods.
@AfterTest
Purpose: @AfterTest is used to clean up after all tests in a <test> tag have completed.
Usage: Common uses for @AfterTest include closing connections, releasing resources, or performing cleanup actions to ensure that the environment is ready for other tests or test suites.
Example: Closing a browser or logging out of an application after all tests have been executed
